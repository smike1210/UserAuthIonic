# Custom User Authentication Using Ionic
### Created By: _Michael Shea_
## Project Description
This project uses the Ionic V3 framework and a Firebase Database. It is meant to be used in the situation where there should only be a specific set of users that should be allowed to sign up for and use a service. These users will be given an initial password and will use their full name with the initial password to sign up for whatever service is using this authentication process. I used this authentication process for a mobile app for my engineering professional fraternity where the users could only be active brothers.
